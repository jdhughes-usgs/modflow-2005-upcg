{"name":"Modflow-2005-upcg","tagline":"MODFLOW-2005 version 1.8 with the UPCG solver","body":"modflow-2005-upcg\r\n=================\r\n\r\nMODFLOW-2005 version 1.10 with the UPCG solver\r\n\r\nThe UPCG solver includes support for parallel solution of MODFLOW on \r\n(1) multi-core CPUs using OpenMP and (2) general purpose graphical\r\nprocessing units (GPGPUs) using the NVIDIA CUBLAS Library.\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation:\r\n\r\nHughes, J.D., and White, J.T., 2012, Use of general purpose graphics processing units with MODFLOW: Ground Water, doi: 10.1111/gwat.12004.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL USE:\r\n\r\nSource code for MODFLOW--2005 with the UPCG solver is available in the code\\src subdirectory. A Microsoft Visual Studio solution and associated fortran, C++, and cu projects are available in the code subdirectory.\r\n\r\nDevelopment and compilation of CUDA and CUBLAS functions requires installation of the CUDA toolkit which includes the necessary CUDA drivers. NVIDIA also provides GPGPU code samples in the CUDA software development kit (SDK). Current versions of each of these are available free of charge from NVIDIA at http://www.nvidia.com/content/cuda/cuda-downloads.html. A 64-bit version of the MODFLOW-2005 executable with the UPCG solver and the linked OpenMP dynamic-link library (DLL) for the Windows 7 operating system and the Tesla C2050 GPGPU is available in the bin subdirectory and only requires installation of the CUDA drivers, which are also available as a stand-alone installation from NVIDIA, and a GPGPU with NVIDIA Compute Capability 2.0 or greater. This executable was linked against version 4.1.28 of the 64-bit CUDA toolkit.\r\n\r\nContact Joseph D. Hughes < jdhughes (at) usgs [dot] gov >\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion History:\r\n\r\no Version 1.0 12/12/2012:\r\n\r\nThis version is the initial release. \r\n\r\no Version 1.1 07/09/2013:\r\n\r\nUpdated MODFLOW source code to version 1.10 and modified the Visual Studio solution and upcgc C++ project to link against version 5.0 of the 64-bit CUDA toolkit. \r\n\r\nModified matrix assembly in UPCG7AP subroutine (upcg7.f) to work with more general MODFLOW problems with wetting and drying, interior inactive cells, and constant head cells.\r\n\r\nAdded relaxation for MILU0 preconditioner and steady-state and transient dampening to all preconditioners.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER and NOTICE\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the USGS Software User Rights Notice (http://water.usgs.gov/software/help/notice/) for complete use, copyright, and distribution information.
